# sustain

Goal: empower consumers to support the businesses they believe in.
How: provide online consumers visibility on a business' social and environmental responsibility.
Tool: chrome extension showing you data about the business and other people feedback.

Issues:
- Had to delete VSCode because I don't have room on my computer anymore.
- The ESG data available on Yahoo Finances is not as relevant as expected.
- Need to have the ESG and business data available in an API to automate the database. (currently scrapping to fill in the database + manual associaltions of brands to a parent company)
